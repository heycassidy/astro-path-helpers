# `astro-path-helpers`

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WORK IN PROGRESS**: This integration is still under active development and not yet ready for production use.

This is an [Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) that generates type-safe path helper functions for your Astro routes, making it easy to manage and reference nested routes in your application.



## Features

- üîí **Type-safe paths** - Generate helper functions based on your Astro routes (e.g., `postPath(post.id")` ‚Üí `/posts/hello`)
- üß† **Smart name handling** - Automatically handles singular and plural forms
- üõ†Ô∏è **Customizable paths** - Override path segments when they don't match Astro routes
- üå≤ **Nested routes support** - *(Coming soon)* Support for deeply nested resource routes

## Usage

`astro-path-helpers` simplifies route management by generating consistent path helper functions based on your configured resources. After setup, you'll have reliable, type-safe links throughout your application. For example, with routes like:

```
src/pages/posts/index.astro
src/pages/posts/[slug].astro
```

You can use these path helpers:

```astro
---
import { postsPath, postPath } from "astro-path-helpers";
---

<a href={postsPath()}>View all posts</a>
<a href={postPath("my-first-post")}>Read my first post</a>
```

### Installation

Install the integration **automatically** using the Astro CLI:

```bash
pnpm astro add astro-path-helpers
```

```bash
npx astro add astro-path-helpers
```

```bash
yarn astro add astro-path-helpers
```

Or install it **manually**:

1. Install the required dependencies

```bash
pnpm add astro-path-helpers
```

```bash
npm install astro-path-helpers
```

```bash
yarn add astro-path-helpers
```

2. Add the integration to your astro config

```diff
+import pathHelpers from "astro-path-helpers/integration";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
+    pathHelpers(),
  ],
});
```

### Configuration

By default, `astro-path-helpers` will scan your Astro routes and generate helper functions automatically. However, you can use the configuration object to:

1. Override path generation for existing routes
2. Add custom path helpers for routes that don't exist yet

The integration accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

```typescript
interface PathHelpersOptions {
  resources: ResourceConfig[];
}

interface ResourceConfig {
  name: string;       // The plural name of the resource (e.g., "posts")
  path?: string;      // Optional path override if different from the name, use this if you want the path segment to be different from the resource name
}
```

### Example Configuration
```typescript
pathHelpers({
  resources: [
    { name: "people", path: "staff" },
  ]
})
```

This configuration generates these helper functions:

- `peoplePath()` ‚Üí `/staff` (uses the custom path "staff" instead of "people")
- `personPath(personId)` ‚Üí `/staff/${personId}` (correctly uses singular "person" form with ID parameter)


## Contributing

This package is structured as a monorepo:

- `playground` contains code for testing the package
- `package` contains the actual package

Install dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
```

Start the playground and package watcher:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can now edit files in `package`. Please note that making changes to those files may require restarting the playground dev server.
